Instructor: Junhyong Kim, junhyong@sas.upenn.edu


This is a course designed for PhD level students who are seeking to pursue a major part of their dissertation projects using computational analysis and modeling. The course will be organized around reading and discussing from posted lecture materials and computational method design for actual research problems (second part of the course). The students will be organized into working groups for the readings and will present the readings to the class. Final projects will involve designing and implementing a computational solution to an actual biological problem. The final project will be worked in teams.
Grades: Grades for this course will be based on weekly participation and on a final group project.
Course Mechanics: The course revolves around student teams giving lectures based on course readings, followed by additional comments from the instructor. The initial sets of lectures will be given by the course instructor, as well as some of the later special topic lectures (see Schedule below). The students will be organized into rotating teams such that you will be working with a different group of students for each lecture.
